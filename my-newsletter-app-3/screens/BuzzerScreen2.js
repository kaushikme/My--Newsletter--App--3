 <Text><h3>US President Donald Trump says he will "not even consider" renaming military bases named for Confederate generals.

He tweeted that the facilities were part of "a Great American heritage".

Mr Trump's remarks follow reports that top military officials were open to changes amid nationwide soul-searching after the death of George Floyd.

For many, symbols of the Confederacy - the slaveholding southern states that seceded, prompting the 1861-65 American Civil War - evoke a racist past.</h3></Text>

<Text><h1> George Floyd death: 'Stop the pain', brother tells US Congress</h1></Text>
<Text><h3> The brother of the African American man whose death in police custody has sparked global protests, has urged the US Congress to pass reforms on police brutality and "stop the pain".

Philonise Floyd told a House hearing that his brother George could not become "another name on a list".

"Be the leaders that this country, this world, needs," Mr Floyd said.

George Floyd died in Minneapolis in May as a white police officer held a knee on his neck for nearly nine minutes. </h3></Text>
